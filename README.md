# Coding Challenges #1 - Slide in Menu - The Net Ninja

This is my solution to [Coding Challenge #1 - Slide in Menu](https://youtu.be/4vefIayqwZw) from @iamshaunjp [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/)

## The Challenge - Slide in Menu

1. Sliding in and out of the menu nav when we hit the burger nav icon
1. Animation of the burger nav icon into the cross and vice versa
1. Burger and cross icon sit at the very top of everything else on the page (it will visible whatever menu nav sliding in or out).

## My Solution - CSS Only

1. Use input type `checkbox` as menu toggler (make invisible)
1. Create menu bar icon using combination of label > span, psedo element `::before` and `::after`
1. Use psedo selector of input type `checkbox` `:checked` to set style of menu bar icon into cross and sliding in or out menu nav
